"""Tests covering the preflight application services.

Purpose:
    Validate that ``ExtractionService`` and ``QueryBuildingService`` orchestrate
    gateway interactions by enforcing limit validation, applying defaults, and
    isolating caller-provided metadata.
External Dependencies:
    Relies on ``pytest`` and project-local domain/application modules only.
Fallback Semantics:
    Exercises service behaviour without simulating gateway fallbacks; tests focus
    on ensuring that services propagate gateway results transparently.
Timeout Strategy:
    No timeouts are triggered during these tests. Blocking operations are not
    performed because gateways are replaced with in-memory stubs.
